# This is a file that has been autogenerated by b2c_mkvars script on 20240808
#
# The purpose of this file is to allow b2c to change the name of variables from
# cryptic names to more useful names for the C-programmer.
# 
# The first column is the original name and should not be changed.  The second
# column (deliniated by an OR-bar '|') is the name you want to give to the 
# variable so that its use is more meaningful.
#
# The program b2c_mkvars will take a program name and extract the relavant information
# from it to generate this file.
